Two projects I created/games using GMS2 during my summer time (March - April) back in 2018.

I completely forgot about them until I found them on my Google Drive. Unfortunately, I am only able to retrieve the built files, and not the code themselves. I am happy I found them nonetheless.

**Enjoy!**
